These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate compilation to work.  One such convention is the \"calling convention\". The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function is found. Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code. The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to call any function specified by a call interface description at run time. FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call code written in another language.  The `libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed between the two languages.","build_epoch":1478363428,"build_epoch_utc":null,"install_date_epoch":1565891596,"install_date_epoch_utc":null},{"name":"dhcp-common","epoch":12,"version":"4.2.5","release":"77.el7.centos","architecture":"x86_64","install_date":"Wed 16 Oct 2019 09:22:01 AM PDT","group":"System Environment/Base","size":245529,"license":"ISC","signature":"RSA/SHA256, Thu 22 Aug 2019 02:22:18 PM PDT, Key ID 24c6a8a7f4a80eb5","source_rpm":"dhcp-4.2.5-77.el7.centos.src.rpm","build_date":"Thu 08 Aug 2019 04:10:22 PM PDT","build_host":"x86-01.bsys.centos.org","relocations":"(not relocatable)","packager":"CentOS BuildSystem <http://bugs.centos.org>","vendor":"CentOS","url":"http://isc.org/products/DHCP/","summary":"Common files used by ISC dhcp client and server","description":"DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol which allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration information (IP address, subnetmask, broadcast address, etc.) from a DHCP server.

This library forms a piece of the base of Open Network Computing (ONC), and is derived directly from the Solaris 2.3 source. TI-RPC is an enhanced version of TS-RPC that requires the UNIX System V Transport Layer Interface (TLI) or an equivalent X/Open Transport Interface (XTI).  TI-RPC is on-the-wire compatible with the TS-RPC, which is supported by almost 70 vendors on all major operating systems.  TS-RPC source code (RPCSRC 4.0) remains available from several internet sites.","build_epoch":1565310923,"build_epoch_utc":null,"install_date_epoch":1571162947,"install_date_epoch_utc":null},{"name":"traceroute","epoch":3,"version":"2.0.22","release":"2.el7","architecture":"x86_64","install_date":"Tue 21 Jul 2020 12:18:31 PM PDT","group":"Applications/Internet","size":93925,"license":"GPLv2+","signature":"RSA/SHA256, Sun 20 Nov 2016 12:54:56 PM PST, Key ID 24c6a8a7f4a80eb5","source_rpm":"traceroute-2.0.22-2.el7.src.rpm","build_date":"Sat 05 Nov 2016 08:27:17 AM PDT","build_host":"worker1.bsys.centos.org","relocations":"(not relocatable)","packager":"CentOS BuildSystem <http://bugs.centos.org>","vendor":"CentOS","url":"http://traceroute.sourceforge.net","summary":"Traces the route taken by packets over an IPv4/IPv6 network","description":"The traceroute utility displays the route used by IP packets on their way to a specified network (or Internet) host.
